The schemas package contains all of the marshmallow schemas required for PyFynance.

PyFynance uses the marshmallow package (https://pypi.org/project/marshmallow/) to serialise and deserialise data to
python objects. Schemas are used to govern the configuration object and enforce/validate data structures parsed from
OFX/QFX files.
